Structure of Program:
File organization: palindrome.cpp
Functional organization: Main() takes input of string and then converts to corresponding data type for functions
and then checks if its a palindrome if not converts into palindrome.

Status: It works well except the integer function thinks strings

Hardware & platform I used: Intel core i7 with 16GB RAM MacOS

Compile: extract the archive and then from shell run "make". This will create executable hw2 and then run ./hw2
